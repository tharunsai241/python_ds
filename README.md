search alogrithms in python
linear search --> It sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched.best-case complexity is O(1) 
                  where the element is found at the first index. Worst-case complexity is O(n) where the element is found at the last index or element is not present in the array

binary search -->algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item,
                  until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.The time complexity of the binary search algorithm is O(log n). The best-case time complexity would be O(1)
